# Minimum-Spanning-Tree-Using-Kruskal-s-Algorithm
This program identifies the Minimum
Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s Algorithm. It shows the edges of the tree and draw the graph representing the Minimum Spanning Tree.

Data sets were gaenerated using separate code by entering the 3 student IDs of group members and the program will generate the data for
the 10 planets (Planets A-J) into a file named “A2planets.txt”.


Given planets map:
